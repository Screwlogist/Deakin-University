1. Define a string variable with your name. Print characters of odd and even position of your name.
2. Create three variables named 'Student name', 'Course name', and 'EmailAddress'. Add 5 random values in these variables, where added values are not replaceable and print them.
3. Create a dictionary variable with three keys, which are named same as the three variables created in the previous problem. Insert the previously created three variables values in the dictionary variable and print it.
4. Define a string variable 'energy' and assign value either 'Fossil' or 'Renewable'. Print "Natural gas" if the value of energy variable is 'Fossil' otherwise print "solar power". What will your program print if energy='Biomass '?
5. Print all prime numbers between 0 and 100 separated by line.
6. Is it possible to break a loop before executing for the defined number of iterations? If yes, provide an example using While loop structure. Otherwise, explain your answer (why and how).
7. Create  functions named  'Addition', 'Multiplication', 'Division' and 'Subtraction'. These functions takes two input parameters say (x, y) and return (x+y),(x*y), (x/y) and (x-y). Call the function with (4,7) arguments and print the outputs
8. Create and display a 8x8 Identity matrix and multiply it with a 8x4 Random matrix.
8. Create a 8x9 matrix, initialise with random values and print it. Now, transpose the matrix and print it. How the transposed matrix is different from original matrix?
10. Expport the "PedestrianCounting.csv" file as a matrix. The row of the matrix represents data point or instance and the column represents the variable or feature. Print the number of data instances and variables present in this dataset. Calculate mean of the third variable and deduct this mean from original values of the variable. Print both original and modified values of the variable.
